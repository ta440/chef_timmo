    1. Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
    2. Add the butter/oil to a pan and melt on the stovetop. 
    3. Take off the heat and stir in the rest of the wet ingredients.
    4. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl.
    5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir well.
    6. Spread the muesli evenly on a baking tray. Ensure this is large enough to have it not layered too high.
    7. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until your desired crunch level. Don't stir during this time, as it breaks the clump formation. Also, pull it out slightly before it's fully done, as it'll continue to cook through residual heat.
    8. Let fully cool on the baking tray and store in an airtight container.

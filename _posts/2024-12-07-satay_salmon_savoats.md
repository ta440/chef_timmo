    1. Finely dice the onion and carrot and add to a large pot. Cook in a splash of oil until soft.
    2. Add the oats and cook for a couple of minutes, until lightly toasted.
    3. Add the finely minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds. 
    4. Add 2 cups of hot water and make sure that nothing is stuck to the bottom of the pot.
    5. Add the kumara and ginger.
    6. Mix the sauce ingredients in a separate bowl. Add a splash of water to get a liquidy consistency; if the sauce is too dry when adding it, the peanut butter might clump instead of evenly dispersing through the savoats.
    7. Add the sauce to the pot. Simmer for thirty minutes or so, until the oats are tender and the kumara is soft. Check the consistency reasonably frequently (also so it doesn't stick) and add extra water as required. There should be a nice thick sauce in the final dish.
    8. About ten minutes before serving, add the frozen pease and tinned salmon, broken into nice chunks. This shouldn't be added too early, else it will disintegrate too much into the sauce.
    9. Serve in bowls and add a garnish of diced ginger. My favourite way to serve this is with a dollop of greek yoghurt and toasted pumpkin seeds.
chef_notes: |-
  * Fish sauce might seem like a strange addition, but it adds a nine kick of umami. Leave this out if you think this step is a bit fishy.
  * This dish is highly customisable with adding other vegetables or aromatics. I have enjoyed adding cpasicum, spring onions, mushrooms, and cooked beetroot in some iterations.
  * This dish also goes well with a freshly cooked naan.

What are savoats you ask? Well, I figure it sounds better than saying one is eating porridge for dinner! This recipe was inspired by wanting
to have satay chicken, but I didn't have chicken, so I made this instead. It thoroughly satisfied the satay tastebuds!

The use of oats is like a creamy risotto with a bit of chew, and controversially, I might prefer the texture of this to many
risottos. If you're game, the leftovers make a lovely warm breakfast in the colder months.

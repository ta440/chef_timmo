recipe:
  servings: 1 :)
  prep: 1-3 hours
  cook: 5 minutes
  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 1/2 (or more) tsp yeast
    * 1/2 tsp salt
    * 3 Tbsp water
    * 1 Tbsp butter
    * 1 Tbsp yoghurt
    * 35g white flour
    * 35g wholemeal flour
  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Mix the yeast, sugar and lukewarm water in a bowl, and let it sit for ten minutes. It should start to bubble and smell funky.
    2. Melt the butter and add to the yeast and water mixture.
    3. Add in the yoghurt and salt.
    4. Add the flour and mix well. Add extra flour/water if needed to get a dough that is cohesive and quite hydrated, but not overly wet. Let sit convered for about 30 minutes.
    5. The dough should have risen after this time. Give it a punch and then shape it into a naan shape.
    6. Let the naan rise for at least thrity minutes, but up to a few hours.
    7. Heat a frying pan. Add the naan to the hot pan and cook for a few minutes on either side. You should get some nice colour on both sides.
    8. Serve with a curry, stew, soup, or even eat on its own with butter!
    chef_notes: |-
    * I like the mix of half white and half wholewheat flour, but you can use all white flour.
    * I also like sprinkling sesame seeds on the naan before cooking, for a nice addition on the exterior.

Naan for one, as opposed to naan $'\forall'$ (sorry, it's a maths joke).

As I am living by myself, I have tinkered with many recipes to make single servings. Here is a quick naan that I can whip up after a day at work and is so much better than anything shop-bought! It is great dipped in curries, but I always rip off a little piece to have just with melted butter.

    1. Preheat the oven to 160Â°C.
    2. Add the butter/oil to a pan and melt on the stovetop. 
    3. Take off the heat and stir in the rest of the wet ingredients.
    4. Mix all the dry ingredients in a bowl.
    5. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir well.
    6. Spread the muesli evenly on a baking tray. Ensure this is large enough to have it not layered too high.
    7. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until your desired crunch level. Don't stir during this time, as it breaks the clump formation. Also, pull it out slightly before it's fully done, as it'll continue to cook through residual heat.
    8. Let fully cool on the baking tray and store in an airtight container.
chef_notes: |-
  * My favourite nuts to use are almonds, pecans and pistachios. For the seeds, I like pumpkin, chia, and sesame; feel free to add sunflower seeds, but I'm not the biggest fan of these here.
  * I like to have a serving of it fresh from the oven on top of a scoop of vanilla icecream. One has to taste test the product, after all!

What is savoats you ask? Well, I figure it sounds better than saying one is eating porridge for dinner! This recipe was inspired by wanting
to have satay chicken, but I didn't have chicken, so I made this instead. It thoroughly satisfied the satay tastebuds!

The use of oats is like a creamy risotto with a bit of chew, and controversially, I might prefer the texture of this to many
risottos. If you're game, the leftovers make a lovely warm breakfast in the colder months.
